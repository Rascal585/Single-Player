Guide for running Open RSC Single Player on Windows:

--Step 1---------------------------------------------------------------

First, you will want to download the latest version of XAMPP for Windows
https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/latest/download

Run through the XAMPP setup, leave everything checked, and if prompted by Windows Defender Firewall - go ahead and click "Allow access"

Once XAMPP Control Panel is open, click the "Start" button for "Apache" and "MySQL". You may have to click "Allow access" for Windows Defender Firewall again here as well.

You may want to also click on the "Config" button and check the boxes for "Apache" and "MySQL" under where it reads "Autostart of modules" and then click "Save" at the bottom. If later you can't run the game server, verify that MySQL is running in XAMPP Control Panel!

You can now visit:
http://localhost/phpmyadmin

The default MySQL username is "root" and there is no password set. Feel free to bookmark this URL as you will be able to use it to edit your player later on.


It is now time to create a database for Open RSC single player to use. From within PHPMyAdmin, click on the tab at the top named "Databases". When the page loads, type "openrsc" for the database name and click the "Create" button. Make sure you name it correctly or the game server won't start.

Now click on the tab at the top that reads "Import".

There will be a "Browse..." button when the page loads for a file to import. Click on that and navigate to the Single Player folder. Import the following file:
"Single-Player -> Required -> openrsc_game_server.sql"

Once the file is selected, click "Open" and then click the "Go" button at the bottom of the page to begin importing the database tables.


The next step is to import the player tables. Click on the "Import" tab at the top of the page again and this time import the following file:
"Single-Player -> Required -> openrsc_game_players.sql"

Once the file is selected, click "Open" and then click the "Go" button at the bottom of the page to begin importing the database tables.


You may have noticed there are similarly named .sql files within the Required folder. These are for other game modes that Single Player supports. 
For RSC Cabbage, you would need to click on the link for "Server: 127.0.0.1" at the very top of the page to return to the home page, then click on the "Databases" tab. When the page loads, type "cabbage" for the database name and click the "Create" button. Make sure you name it correctly or the game server won't start.

Repeat the steps listed earlier for importing "cabbage_game_server.sql" and "cabbage_game_players.sql"

You can access the various databases on the left hand side of the page too.

The reason why we split the .sql file imports into two parts is so that future versions of Open RSC can be downloaded and you can simply import only the "openrsc_game_server.sql" for NPC/item/quest/etc updates and not overwrite your hard earned player save data.

--Step 2---------------------------------------------------------------

Next, download Open JDK 12 for Windows (MSI installer version) and if you already have Java installed (ex: Oracle Java 8), then it is highly suggested that you first uninstall it. Oracle will not be supporting non-enterprise Java much longer and Open JDK is the future.

--Step 3---------------------------------------------------------------

You are now ready to double click on "Windows Open-RSC.cmd" which is located in the "Single-Player" folder.

Once open, press 1 and then press enter. This is for the option of "Run Single Player".

A new window will open stating that the game will start up in 10 seconds. If you encounter an error where the game window just turns gray and reads "Loading..." and the command prompt window says "java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect", this may be due to the MySQL server not running. To fix it, open XAMPP Control Panel and click the button named "Start" beside "MySQL".

You will now need to click "New User" to create a player. If your mouse cursor suddenly becomes locked in place, press the ALT key once and then it should be back to normal. The ALT key lets you freely move the camera around with the mouse.

If you become stuck on Tutorial Island or just wish to skip it, there is a link in the in-game options menu above the log out that reads "skip tutorial".

--Step 4---------------------------------------------------------------

At this point, you may wish to use different game features than the default RSC ones. This requires you to fully exit the game client and the game server (use choice #2 to exit in the command prompt window) to fully shut it down.


Now navigate to "Single-Player -> Required -> server" and make a copy of "rsccabbage.conf", renaming the duplicate file "local.conf". Same applies for "openrsc.conf" and the other files in that directory. If "local.conf" exists, the game server will override the settings that are in "default.conf". Think of "openrsc.conf" and "rsccabbage.conf" as ready to go config presets.

One last important step: inside of each .conf file within "Single Player -> Required -> server" is an entry of:
<entry key = "mysql_pass"></entry>

If you change the MySQL root user's password, make sure to set this in each .conf file or the game server will not start.


Also, if you opt to use different named databases, edit the following line in your "local.conf" (or default.conf) to match the name of your database:
<entry key = "mysql_db">cabbage</entry>


It is strongly suggested that you do not edit "default.conf" and instead make a copy of whatever .conf file, rename it to "local.conf" and edit that instead. That way, you always have working config to fall back on if something doesn't work the way you wish.

Last but not least, always restart the game server after fully exiting it when you have made changes to your "local.conf" in order to have them be applied. An already running server will not read any changes to the file.

--Step 5---------------------------------------------------------------

Creating an in-game admin player:
Once you have created a new player and logged out of the game (will not save database update changes otherwise!), you will be able to open PHPMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin), navigate to the database of the game you are running (openrsc, cabbage, etc) and click on the "openrsc_players" table. It will list out all of your players here. If you double click on the cell for the desired player under the column for "group_id" and change the "10" to a "0" and press enter, your player will be an admin in-game when you next log in.
